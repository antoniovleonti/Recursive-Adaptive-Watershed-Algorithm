# Recursive-Adaptive-Watershed-Algorithm
This is a reimplmentation of the algorithm from the paper "Quantification of the morphology of shelly carbonate sands using 3D images" by D. KONG and J. FONSECA (http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/jgeot.16.P.278). This code is easier to read, is more effective in my benchmarks, and is faster than the original code. It's also recursive, which is cool.
